## Let Your Data Flow

*ryvr* provides highly optimised access to your data, when it's stored as a series of immutable events.
Think bank transaction lists, trade histories, log records, and similar. 
 
Perfect for sending events from [OLTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing) systems to [OLAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing) systems, for indexing, reporting and analytics, or for sending though to complex event processing.
