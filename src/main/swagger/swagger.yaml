      A Link Object represents a hyperlink from the containing resource to a URI.

    properties:
      href:
        type: string
        format: uri
        description: |
          The "href" property is REQUIRED.

          Its value is either a URI https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986 or a URI Template https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570.

          If the value is a URI Template then the Link Object SHOULD have a
          "templated" attribute whose value is true.
      templated:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |
          The "templated" property is OPTIONAL.

          Its value is boolean and SHOULD be true when the Link Object's "href"
          property is a URI Template.

          Its value SHOULD be considered false if it is undefined or any other
          value than true.
      type:
        type: string
        description: |
          The "type" property is OPTIONAL.

          Its value is a string used as a hint to indicate the media type
          expected when dereferencing the target resource.
      deprecation:
        type: string
        format: uri
        description: |
          The "deprecation" property is OPTIONAL.

          Its presence indicates that the link is to be deprecated (i.e.
          removed) at a future date.  Its value is a URL that SHOULD provide
          further information about the deprecation.

          A client SHOULD provide some notification (for example, by logging a
          warning message) whenever it traverses over a link that has this
          property.  The notification SHOULD include the deprecation property's
          value so that a client maintainer can easily find information about
          the deprecation.
      name:
        type: string
        description: |
          The "name" property is OPTIONAL.

          Its value MAY be used as a secondary key for selecting Link Objects
          which share the same relation type.
      profile:
        type: string
        format: uri
        description: |
          The "profile" property is OPTIONAL.

          Its value is a string which is a URI that hints about the profile (as
          defined by https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-profile-link-04) of the target resource.
      title:
        type: string
        description: |
          The "title" property is OPTIONAL.

          Its value is a string and is intended for labelling the link with a
          human-readable identifier (as defined by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988).
      hreflang:
        type: string
        description: |
          The "hreflang" property is OPTIONAL.

          Its value is a string and is intended for indicating the language of
          the target resource (as defined by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988).
