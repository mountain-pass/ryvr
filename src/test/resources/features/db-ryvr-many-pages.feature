Feature: DB Many Pages
    In order create projections from the events that have happened in a DB
    As a user
    I want to get a paginated list of events from the DB

  Background: 
    Given a database "test_db"
    And it has a table "transactions" with the following structure
      | id          | INT           |
      | account     | VARCHAR(255)  |
      | description | VARCHAR(255)  |
      | amount      | DECIMAL(19,4) |
    And it has 46 events
    And a database ryvr with the following configuration
      | name      | transactions                                                                          |
      | query     | select `id`, `account`, `description`, `amount` from `transactions` ORDER BY `id` ASC |
      | page size |                                                                                    10 |

  Scenario: Get Ryvr - Multiple Pages - Current Page
    When the "transactions" ryvr is retrieved
    Then it will have the following structure
      | id | account | description | amount |
    And it will have 46 events
